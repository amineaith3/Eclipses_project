# Summary :

We developed an educational project using Python and Pygame to explain the intricate concept of eclipses. 

Our project includes an informative video presentation that simplifies the mechanism of eclipses and an interactive quiz to assess the user's knowledge. 

By leveraging multimedia elements, we aim to make the understanding of eclipses more accessible and engaging to a broad audience. 

The project's importance lies in enhancing scientific literacy, sparking curiosity about astronomy, and promoting a deeper understanding of natural astronomical events.
